# Formers on the tcc-evm-contract host

The front end of this kit is a copy of the tcc-wasm front end. `langc check`
and `langc eval` accept the formers F1 to F15 as that front end does, F16 (`elim`), F17 (`Glue`, `glue`, `unglue`), F18 (indexed families) and F19 (`and` blocks).
`test/gate.sh` runs the examples on them.

In orbit-lang S3, the kit examples and contract operations below require
`--kit` before the command, for example `build/langc --kit check
examples/formers.lang` or `build/langc --kit build examples/contract.lang`.
Without `--kit`, guest mode refuses kit types, operations, literals and
contract declarations with `REFUSE_KIT`. `examples/signature.lang` is a
guest example and checks without `--kit`; the gate uses the `kit.txt`
lists to select each example's mode.

## EVM output (slice K4, done in the kit)

`langc build` lowers a contract to EVM bytecode (docs/host/README.md,
section `EVM output`). The facts a program author needs:

- The state is a list of word fields: Nat, Flag, U256 and Addr. A `List T`
  field holds words (T a word type). A `Map K V` field holds one word per
  key. An Option field, a Prod field, a nested List, a List over a type
  that is not a word give REFUSE_LOWER (K4a). Map keys must be Nat, U256
  or Addr; values must be Nat, Flag, U256 or Addr. Other Map types give
  REFUSE_MAP during checking. A Map nested in another state field gives
  REFUSE_STATE.
- An entry body lowers to first-order word code: the word values, Option,
  Prod, `flagIf` and `if`. `some (pair STATE OUT)` stores the changed
  fields, `none` reverts, a trap reverts with `Trap()` (K4b).
- A view returns one word (K4c). A residual `fold` over a List field runs
  its body once per element, from the last element to the head. Its seed
  and step must lower to words. If either can trap, the step must be
  provably strict in its accumulator, or the build gives REFUSE_LOWER.
  A residual fold at a word position that is not over a List field also
  gives REFUSE_LOWER (K4c). Folds that normalize to words before lowering,
  such as a sum over a closed `cons` chain, can build.
- `pay` and `pull` are token CALLs (K4d). `emit` has no EVM form: use a
  named event.
- The formers F1 to F19 are checked and evaluated (F12 and F13 as `Path`
  since sealed-lang S3). On the EVM only the first-order word residual of a body
  lowers. A residual of another form gives REFUSE_LOWER
  (`test/lower/expect.txt`, 16 rows).

## The base span (sealed-lang S2, ported in orbit-lang S2)

| Op | `check` and `eval` | EVM | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `natDiv`, `natMod` | DONE. A divisor 0 traps. | DONE: DIV and MOD with the zero trap. | The `ratio` and `remainder` eval rows of `examples/entries.lang`; `leafStep` in `test/precompile.sh`. |
| `hash` | DONE: KECCAK256 of two words (`src/keccak.c`). | DONE: the IR op KECCAK. | The eval row `precompile hashZero`; the chain step `hashv`. |
| `addrToU256` | DONE. | DONE: the word itself. | The eval row `ownerWord`; the chain step `addrWord`. |
| `ecrecover` | OPAQUE: a closed application stays stuck. | DONE: one STATICCALL to precompile 1; the output word is stored 0 first. | The chain steps `recover` and `recoverSum`. |
| `ecAdd`, `ecMul` | OPAQUE. | DONE: one STATICCALL to 6 or 7; the result is a two-word block; `first` and `second` read it. | The chain steps `addX`, `addY`, `mulX`, `mulY`, `addBad`. |
| `ecPairing` | OPAQUE. | DONE: one STATICCALL to 8 over a closed list of pairs, 6 words per pair. An open list gives REFUSE_LOWER. | The chain steps `pairOk` and `pairNil`; `test/lower/pairing-open.lang`. |

Removed in sealed-lang S2 (R19): `natMul`, `u256Mul`, `u256Div` and `u256Min`
(`test/check/pruned-op.lang` expects NAME_UNKNOWN). Removed in sealed-lang S2 (R21):
the sample domain. `test/precompile.sh` is the only check of the curve
words: each constant was confirmed by a direct `evm run --input` to the
precompile before it entered the script.

## Paths (sealed-lang S3, ported in orbit-lang S2)

| Op | `check` and `eval` | EVM | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `I`, `i0`, `i1`, `~`, `/\`, `\/` | DONE: the interval and its De Morgan algebra. `I` is not a type: only a path abstraction or a PathP line binds an interval variable. | Erased. | `examples/paths.lang`; INTERVAL_TYPE rows `interval-type.lang`, `interval-pi.lang`, `interval-path.lang`. |
| `PathP`, `Path`, `refl`, `@` | DONE: a path abstraction must meet its ends. No rule makes two paths with the same ends equal (no UIP). | Erased. A path residual at a word position gives REFUSE_LOWER. | `examples/paths.lang`; PATH_END rows `path-end.lang`, `bad-refl.lang`; PATH_UIP rows `path-uip.lang`, `path-k.lang`, `path-ev.lang`; `test/lower/path-word.lang`. |
| `sym`, `cong` | DONE. | Erased. | The eval rows `equality back`, `equality backEnd`; the PATH_UIP row `path-sym.lang`; pathtool "dependent symmetry", "dependent congruence". |
| `funExt` | DONE in `check` only: it elaborates to a path abstraction (R29). | Erased. | `examples/paths.lang` `pointwise`; pathtool "dependent function extensionality". |
| `transp` | DONE: the identity on a base line (Nat, Flag, U256, Addr, Unit, Map; R27); Pi, Sigma, data and universe lines reduce. | Normalizes before lowering; a remaining Kan operation at a word position gives REFUSE_LOWER. | The eval rows `kan evPi`, `kan evPair`; TRANSP_LINE row `transp-line.lang`; pathtool "stuck transport fill". |
| `hcomp` | DONE: a system of faces. At the R27 base types on a face other than `i1`, a literal base is returned only when every live branch evaluates to that literal at a fresh interval; otherwise it stays stuck, as does a neutral base. On `i1`, a true system branch is selected at `i1`. Each step spends `m->fuel` (R28). | Normalizes before lowering; a remaining Kan operation at a word position gives REFUSE_LOWER. | The eval row `kan evTrans`; rows `system-cover.lang`, `system-overlap.lang`, `hcomp-cap.lang`, `hcomp-universe.lang`; pathtool "hcomp over a literal word base". |

The kit `Eq` is out since sealed-lang S3 (sealed-lang O3): the six Eq rows of BUILTINS. `transport`,
`subst`, `J`, `JRefl` and `trans` are guest defs in `domain/domain.lang`
(R25). `build/pathtool` (`test/pathtool.c`) does 19 quote and parse
roundtrips. The existing EVM regressions still pass with the sealed-lang S2 counts
(evm 43, diff 15, emit 24). Path-specific EVM coverage includes the
refusal of a remaining hcomp at a word position (`test/lower/path-word.lang`).

## HITs and QITs (sealed-lang S4, ported in orbit-lang S2)

| Form | `check` and `eval` | EVM | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Path constructor | DONE: a `family` constructor with interval fields `(i : I)` and a boundary system; each boundary is checked (HIT_BOUNDARY). A constructor of an indexed family states its result index, and each end of its boundary is at that index (HIT_INDEX, orbit-lang S6). A constructor of dimension 2 (squash0, quotSquash) has path fields. At an end it reduces to its boundary; at a neutral interval it stays neutral. No rule makes `loop` equal to `refl`. | A point constructor value lowers as a family value. A path constructor residual is not a word: REFUSE_LOWER (R31). | `examples/circle.lang`; PATH_UIP row `loop-not-refl.lang`; fronttool `domain` rows (HIT_BOUNDARY); DOMAIN_FAMILY row `state-boundary.lang`; pathtool "path constructor at a neutral interval". |
| `fold` over a HIT | DONE: one case for each path constructor, at the type of its boundary. A fold of Trunc0 or of a family with a set squash needs the isSet case (S3 removes Quot). `fold_path` applies the path case at the interval; `fold_hcomp` maps to `hcomp` on the target type (R33); `fold_square` folds the path fields of a square. | At an end the fold gives the point case. A stuck `hcomp` on a word type gives REFUSE_LOWER. | TYPE_MISMATCH rows `fold-missing-path.lang`, `trunc0-no-set.lang`; PATH_END row `fold-path-boundary.lang`; the eval rows `trunc truncMapped`, `quot toTrunc3`; `test/lower/loop-word.lang`; pathtool "fold boundary maps a point constructor path field", "fold square boundary preserves captured intervals in path fields". |
| `hcomp` at a HIT | DONE: a composite of path constructor values is a formal hcomp (a canonical value). | Erased. REFUSE_LOWER at a word position. | `examples/circle.lang` `loop2`; pathtool "formal hcomp at a HIT". |
| `transp` at a HIT | DONE: the identity at a family with no parameters. Along a parameter line `transp_family` reduces and keeps a boundary that depends on the parameter; squash0 stays stuck. | Erased. | `examples/circle.lang` `transpBase`; PATH_UIP row `squash0-not-rebuild.lang`; pathtool "transport of a formal hcomp at Trunc1 along a parameter line", "transport preserves a parameter-dependent HIT boundary", "transport of squash0 along a parameter line stays stuck". |

Sealed-lang S4 adds no BUILTINS row (66). The families S1, Trunc1, Trunc0 and Quot
are in `domain/domain.lang` (R32). `build/pathtool` does 26 quote and
parse roundtrips. The EVM regressions did not change at any sealed-lang S4 step (evm
43, diff 15, emit 24, runs 5, run refusals 10): a HIT value is erased.

## Indexed families and blocks (orbit-lang S6)

| Form | `check` and `eval` | EVM | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Index telescope | DONE: `family D (p : P) : J -> Type 0` in `domain/domain.lang`. Each constructor states its result. A constructor with no result, a result with a wrong head or an end at another index gives HIT_INDEX. `Prop` in the telescope gives NAME_UNKNOWN. | Erased. | `examples/hiit.lang`; fronttool `domain` rows `hiit-wrong-index`, `hiit-no-result`, `hiit-wrong-head` (HIT_INDEX), `index-prop` (NAME_UNKNOWN). |
| `and` block | DONE: the headers bind first, then the point constructors, then the path constructors of all sorts. A header that names its own sort or a later sort gives BLOCK_ORDER. | Erased. | `examples/qiit.lang`; fronttool `domain` rows `block-order` (BLOCK_ORDER), `block-ok`. |
| `fold` over an indexed sort or a block | DONE: one constant target for an indexed sort. For a block: one target for each sort, the cases sort by sort in declaration order, then the value. The parameters of the scrutinee must inhabit the telescope of each sort. A field of another sort folds at the target of that sort. `transp` at an indexed or block sort stays neutral. | Erased. | TYPE_MISMATCH rows `bag-no-squash.lang`, `block-fold-target.lang`, `block-fold-no-squash.lang`; fronttool rows `block-fold-extra` and Even/Odd; the eval rows `hiit bagTwoCount`, `bagSwapCount`, `qiit adoptedZero`, `adoptedTwo`, `adoptedLaw`. |

The families Size, Bag, Charter and Ratified are in `domain/domain.lang`
(lines 50 to 78). The EVM regressions do not change in orbit-lang S6 (evm
43, diff 15, emit 24, runs 5, run refusals 10, lower refusals 16): a value
of an indexed or block sort is erased.
